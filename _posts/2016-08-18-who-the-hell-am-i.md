I'm Andrew Gordon, I was born on a cold November morning...Blah Blah.

I'm a marketer, a Business Dev Guy, an Uber Geek and Entrepreneur. I have been in sales with companies since I was 10, (No seriously my mom created a sales person straight from the get go. I was selling newspaper subscriptions in the summer to earn extra cash and 

Unfortunetly, unlike Warren Buffet I didn't save everything I earned and bought my parent's farm (they didn't have one).

My wife says that I have Entrepreneur ADHD, and she is most likely right. I tend to see the profitability in a tooth pick and my mind tends to take that away and make a 5 year plan for it.

Why am I writing this website? Simple, I like to write and I am a little tired of titles getting in the way of what a role's nature should be. A role that is multi faceted and can provide so much to an organization. I see a lot of good people in the world, entrepreneurs, intra-preneurs, etc. that have a hard time establishing what is needed to succeed only because of simple semantics.

So if I can help one person out there create something amazing in what they do I consider it a win!
